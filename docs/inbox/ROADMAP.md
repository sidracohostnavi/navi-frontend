# Inbox Product Roadmap

## Phase 1: Aggregation (Completed)
- [x] **Email Ingestion:** Parse Airbnb/VRBO emails.
- [x] **Unified List:** Single view for all conversations.
- [x] **Status Workflow:** New -> Draft -> Sent.

## Phase 2: Intelligence (Current)
- [ ] **Smart Templates:** "Suggest 'Parking Instructions' based on question".
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis:** Detect angry guests (score -1.0 to 1.0).
- [ ] **Auto-Responder:** Whitelist specific questions ("What is the wifi?") for auto-reply.

## Phase 3: Channels
- [ ] **SMS Integration:** Twilio support for direct text messaging.
- [ ] **WhatsApp:** For international guests.
- [ ] **Native API:** Use Airbnb Official API instead of Email Parsing (Long term goal).

## Phase 4: Team Operations
- [ ] **Assignments:** Assign a conversation to a specific support agent.
- [ ] **Internal Notes:** Private comments on a thread ("Guest asked for late checkout, I said yes").
